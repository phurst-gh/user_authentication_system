// Serialization:
// During the login process, Passport.js serializes the user object, typically by extracting a unique identifier (such as the user ID) from the user object.
// The serialized user data is then stored in the session.

// Deserialization:
// On subsequent requests, when the user makes a request and includes the session identifier (usually stored in a cookie), Passport.js needs to "deserialize" the user.
// The deserialization process involves taking the stored session data (usually the user ID) and using it to retrieve the full user object from the database or another storage mechanism.
